Electron-React App

This will be a standalone password generator

a few fields to fill out before the generation
  -how long should the password be?
  -should the password contain special characters?

The app should also have a 'copy to clipboard' button

5/15

generation works

need to create the form

form is done

Need to:
  -make it look nice
  -add copy to clipboard button 


5/16

It looks nice
the copy to clipbaord button is added

I made a CLI interface too

The problem today is that the select component has too many options which doesnt look great 
I'm looking into making a smoother option list

made select look smoother
